# MyArrayList
## Description
1. Implement your ArrayList (non-thread-safe Methods - add an element, add an element by index, get an element, delete an element, clear the entire collection, sort, the rest as desired
2. Implement the quicksort algorithm for the ArrayList implementation you have implemented. Link to an excellent description of the algorithm. Your QuickSort should take an ArrayList of any type and sort it. Use: o Java generics o Comparable, Comparator
3. Document the code. What, why and how All classes and interfaces should be documented at the class level (class-level javadoc) All public methods of your implementations should contain javadoc Documentation should be in full and provide an exhaustive and intuitive guide to using your code for another developer
4. All parts of the code must be covered by Unit tests
